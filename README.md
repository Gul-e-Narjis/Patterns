"Let's go over the key changes made in both programs.

First, in the Observer Pattern program:
1Ô∏è‚É£ Added a detach(Observer o) method in Subject.java, so observers can be removed dynamically. This prevents unnecessary updates.
2Ô∏è‚É£ Updated ObserverPatternDemo.java to detach an observer at runtime, allowing only active observers to receive updates.
‚úî Now, notifications are more efficient and flexible, just like unsubscribing from alerts.

Next, in the Event-Driven Notification System:
1Ô∏è‚É£ Added SMSNotificationListener.java, which checks if an SMS message exceeds 160 characters before sending. If too long, it warns the user.
2Ô∏è‚É£ Modified Demo.java to subscribe the SMS listener when saving a file.
‚úî Now, users get SMS alerts along with email and log notifications.

üîπ Overall, these changes make both programs more dynamic, efficient, and real-world applicable.
